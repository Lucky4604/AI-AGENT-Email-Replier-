# Email Processing Fixes

## Problem
Your email processing system was sending multiple replies to the same email due to:
1. **Too frequent cron jobs** - Running every minute instead of every 5 minutes
2. **Race conditions** - Multiple processing instances running simultaneously
3. **Insufficient error handling** - Emails not being marked as read when errors occurred

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Processing Lock
- Added `isProcessing` flag to prevent multiple simultaneous processing
- Ensures only one email processing cycle runs at a time

### 2. Improved Cron Schedule
- Changed from `* * * * *` (every minute) to `*/5 * * * *` (every 5 minutes)
- Reduces server load and prevents race conditions

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Emails are marked as read even if processing fails
- Prevents infinite retry loops
- Improved logging with UID tracking

### 4. Enhanced Email Reader Service
- Better connection management with try-catch-finally blocks
- More robust email parsing with fallback handling
- Improved logging for debugging

## New Features

### 1. Processing Status Endpoint
```bash
GET /email-processing-status
```
Returns the current processing state.

### 2. Reset Processing State
```bash
POST /reset-email-processing
```
Manually resets the processing lock if it gets stuck.

### 3. Test Script
```bash
# Install axios dependency
npm install

# Test email processing
node test-email-processing.js test

# Check processing status
node test-email-processing.js status

# Reset processing state
node test-email-processing.js reset
```

## How to Use

1. **Restart your application** to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

2. **Monitor the logs** to see improved logging:
   ```
   [MailProcessorService] Cron job scheduled to run every 5 minutes
   [MailProcessorService] Starting scheduled email processing...
   [MailProcessorService] Email processing already in progress, skipping...
   ```

3. **Use the test script** to monitor processing:
   ```bash
   node test-email-processing.js test
   ```

## Expected Behavior Now

- ✅ Emails are processed only once
- ✅ Processing runs every 5 minutes instead of every minute
- ✅ No duplicate replies sent
- ✅ Better error handling and logging
- ✅ Processing lock prevents race conditions

## Troubleshooting

If you still see duplicate processing:

1. **Check processing status**:
   ```bash
   node test-email-processing.js status
   ```

2. **Reset processing state** if stuck:
   ```bash
   node test-email-processing.js reset
   ```

3. **Check logs** for any errors or warnings

4. **Restart the application** if issues persist

## Configuration

You can adjust the cron schedule in `src/services/mailProcessor-service.ts`:
```typescript
@Cron('*/5 * * * *') // Every 5 minutes
// Change to:
@Cron('*/10 * * * *') // Every 10 minutes
@Cron('0 */1 * * *')  // Every hour
```
